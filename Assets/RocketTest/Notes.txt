There seems to be some issue with the mass of an object in Unity. From what I have read the mass does not mean the mass of an object but some sort of ratio that is relative to other objects. It is also recommended to keep the value between 0.1 - 10. Again, this is just what I have read, but for now I treat "mass" as what it should be. But if something weird happens, this note will point out a possible reason.
